# grabfav
I use KeepassX and like to get the website icons for the entries in my database. 
This utility uses a google url to download the icon for a given url and save it
in the current working directory as a png.


## Installation
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gangleri/grabfav/master/install.sh | sudo sh
```

## Usage
```
% grabfav google.com
# google.com.png will be placed in the current directory
```
