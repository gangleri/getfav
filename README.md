# grabfav
I use [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) and like to get the website icons for 
the entries in my database. This utility uses Google's S2 Converter to download 
the icon for a given url and saves it in the current working as a png.


## Installation
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gangleri/grabfav/master/install.sh | sudo sh
```

## Usage
```
% grabfav google.com
# google.com.png will be placed in the current directory
```
